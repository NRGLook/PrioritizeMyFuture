# PrioritizeMyFuture

This time management app, PrioritizeMyFuture, is designed to teach you how to truly value time. It offers two main containers, referred to as "banks":

a) The Bank of Today  
b) The Bank of The Future Me  

### Bank of Today
In the Bank of Today, you can allocate your time and tasks for the current day. Here's how it works:

1. Choose the start time of your day. This can be at any time convenient for you, whether it's morning, evening, or night. This will be the daily reset point for the bank.
2. You'll start with a default allocation of time, represented by "conditional units" (e.g., 1440 units, equivalent to 1440 minutes, representing 1 day).
3. After familiarizing yourself with the app's functionality, you can start adding tasks to allocate your time effectively.

### Bank of The Future Me
The Bank of The Future Me represents the time that you've allocated for future tasks. Here's how it works:

- Any unallocated time from the Bank of Today will be transferred to The Bank of The Future Me.
- Discover more about how you can utilize your future time by downloading the PrioritizeMyFuture application.

Appreciate the time, as it's one of the most valuable resources everyone possesses.
